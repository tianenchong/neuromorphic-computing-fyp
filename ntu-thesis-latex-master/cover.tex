\section*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank my supervisor, Assoc Prof S. N. Piramanayagam, for introducing me to Spintronics technologies, keeping me on the right track and training me in my presentation skill.

I would like to acknowledge Asst Prof Mohamed M. Sabry for his guidance through each stage of the design process and defining challenging next steps.

My PhD mentor, Arko, was instrumental in assisting me in setting up the software environment and diagnosing software technical problem.

I am also thankful to HESL lab manager, Mr Chua for providing reliable server access so that I can work remotely from home on this project, particularly in times of pandemic.

Also not forgetting Cadence Design System and foundry partners for making the software and technologies available for access on the computing platform in the lab.

For these, I am extremely grateful to all of them.
